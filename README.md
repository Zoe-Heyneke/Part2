Changes from Part 1 based on feedback:
I made 3 changes to improve from my Part. The first change was my layout of showing messages to the user, thus I moved some Console.WriteLine(“”); parts at the beginning of when the menu system must run so that it will only show once and not repeat itself. Next, I added a switch case so that the user can choose what their unit of measurement is which will add more user connectivity to the application. Lastly, I took out all my methods that was inside each case of the menu system and gave them their own method name so that in the case I can only call the method name and not the steps making my code more organized and structured for future use.
